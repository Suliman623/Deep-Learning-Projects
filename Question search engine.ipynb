        "In this assignment I comprehensively explored the application of transformer models for duplicate question detection using the Quora Question Pairs dataset. We began by evaluating a pre-trained BERT model's performance, achieving 90.84% validation accuracy through optimized GPU processing with batch operations and mixed precision. We then compared four transformer architectures—fine-tuned BERT, DeBERTa v3, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT—analyzing their accuracy, inference speed, and model size trade-offs, with fine-tuned BERT excelling in accuracy (92.60%) while DistilBERT dominated in speed (3,989 samples/sec) and efficiency. Finally, we implemented a functional duplicate question search pipeline that successfully identifies semantically similar questions from the training set, demonstrating both naive and optimized versions with confidence thresholding, thereby completing a full-cycle exploration from model evaluation to practical application in question similarity detection."

For isntance, you can form a short-list of potential candidates using a cheaper method, and then run your tranformer on that short list. If you opted for this solution, please keep both the original implementation and the optimized one - and explain briefly what is the difference there."

        "\n",
        "The two-stage retrieval system represents a massive performance breakthrough while maintaining the semantic accuracy that makes BERT so valuable. By combining the speed of keyword retrieval with the precision of neural re-ranking, we've created a system that is:\n",
        "\n",
        "51x faster than the original approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Highly accurate for semantic duplicate detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalable to very large question databases\n",
        "\n",
        "Production-ready for real-world applications\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation successfully demonstrates how to overcome the computational limitations of transformer models while preserving their powerful semantic understanding capabilities - making duplicate question detection feasible for real-time applications with large-scale datasets!\n",
